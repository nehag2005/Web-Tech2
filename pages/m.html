      Hello there, I'm a Munchkin cat, a unique and adorable breed known for my short legs.
      The breed's origins can be traced back to Louisiana in the early 1990s, where a short-legged cat named Blackberry
      was found.
      My breed got its name from the Munchkin characters in 'The Wizard of Oz' due to our resemblance to them with our
      short stature.
      I come in a variety of colors and patterns, from solid colors to tabby and everything in between.
      Overall, I may be short in stature, but I'm big on personality and love, bringing joy and laughter to any home
      lucky enough to have me.
